## Description: 
I was motivated to help out the community and give someone a platform to work on.
I built this so people can have a place to look for paintings snd be able to communicate with the artist.
This project will allow the user to post their personal work and get community feedback.
I learned that small challenges can become bigger if you dont put neccessary attention to the problem.
